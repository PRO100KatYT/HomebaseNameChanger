### How to use it?

- After starting the HomebaseNameChanger.py, you will be asked to insert the auth code. To get it, go to the Epic Games website [using this link](https://www.epicgames.com/id/logout?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epicgames.com%2Fid%2Flogin%3FredirectUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.epicgames.com%252Fid%252Fapi%252Fredirect%253FclientId%253Dec684b8c687f479fadea3cb2ad83f5c6%2526responseType%253Dcode "Here is the link :D") and log in.

- After logging in, a page should open with content similar to this:

```json
{"redirectUrl":"https://accounts.epicgames.com/fnauth?code=930884289b5852842271e9027376a527","authorizationCode":"930884289b5852842271e9027376a527","sid":null}
```
- Copy the code (e.g. 930884289b5852842271e9027376a527), paste it into the program and press enter.

- The program should say it has logged in.  Now you will be asked to enter a new Homebase name.

- After you insert the name press enter.

- If all went well, the program will say that the Homebase name has been changed from x to y. If not, read the error and try again.

- Congratulations, you just changed your Homebase name!
